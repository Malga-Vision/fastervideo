## FasterVideo for efficient joint detection and tracking
This repository is based on Detectron2 from FAIR 
https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2

This code performs joint detection and tracking for object tracking tasks.
Using Faster R-CNN and an additional Embeddings head (trained using triplet loss) the method is trained and tested on several datasets and benchmarks (KITTI, MOT17, MOT20)
